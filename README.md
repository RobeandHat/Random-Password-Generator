# Random-Password-Generator

## What is this website for?
This website is for the production of complex passwords for people with access to sensitive material. It allows for the quick production of a random series of letters, numbers, and symbols.

## What does this code do?

This code generates a password between 8-128 characters with options for lower/upper case letters, special characters, and numbers. The user can select those options using checkboxes and the length can be selected by either typing or up/down arrows. The generated password is then pasted to a display box which can then be copied for use. 

## Citations
There are many different methodologies to produce a password generator that does the same thing. Therefore, I naturally borrowed code from several different sources and tweaked them for my individual needs.
